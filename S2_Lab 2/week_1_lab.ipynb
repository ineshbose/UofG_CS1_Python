    "__SwapSort__ is a bit similar to __BubbleSort__. In __SwapSort__, during the first pass the first and second elements are compared, but then the third and fourth elements are compared, and so on until the end of the list is reached. During the second pass, the first element is skipped and the second and third elements are compared, then the fourth and fifth and so on. Write a function that implements the `swapSort` algorithm for sorting a list of integers."
