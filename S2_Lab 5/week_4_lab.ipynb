    "This exercise is to make the birthday book program robust by detecting and/or handling as many errors as possible and giving informative error messages to the user. There are many possibilities for errors in the input to the program. For example, the file of birthdays might not exist or might not have the correct format; the dates can be invalid (e.g. Feb 31); when finding a person's birthday, the person might not be in the birthday book; when asking for birthdays in a given month, the name of the month might be incorrect; the user might enter an incorrect command in response to the top-level prompt; and so on.\n",

    "Modify the birthday book program so that as many errors as you can think of are detected. In some cases, for example trying to open a non-existent file, you should handle the exception raised by the built-in Python function. In other cases, you might like to raise and handle your own exceptions, or you might prefer to use other techniques (for example, checking that the top-level command is correct can be done easily with a series of if statements)."
